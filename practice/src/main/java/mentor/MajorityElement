Q2 - Majority Element
 
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
 
Constraints:
 
* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
* -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
 
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
